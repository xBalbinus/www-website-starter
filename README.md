# NEXTJS-SASS-BASE

**[Live Demo](https://wireframes.internet.dev)**

Our extensive experience in building numerous websites has led us to create this template repository as an efficient starting point. If you're keen on developing websites alongside the [Internet Development Studio Company](https://internet.dev), we highly recommend utilizing this template as your foundation.

This version of the template repository was made to be as light as possible.

### Setup (MacOS)

Start by cloning the repository, or by clicking on **Use this template** above.

You will have wanted to setup your development environment by following steps [here](https://github.com/internet-development/nextjs-sass-starter/issues/3).

Then run the server

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:10000` in your browser of choice.

Enjoy! The template uses `10000` as our `port` for more compatibility with [Render.com](https://render.com)

### Scripts (Optional)

If you need to run node script without running the server, use this example to get started

```sh
npm run script example
```
